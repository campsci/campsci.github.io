always remembering to use
```
#include <string>
```
String, in this syntax, is called a library. When using C++, you must use various libraries as references in order to
write certain funtions, to use different words in a vertain way. If you want to write using a string, you have to tell
the compiler "Hey, I want to use the string library". In a way, this is similar to having prerequisites in life. We want
to be in certain places and use different dunctions but we must first complete prerequisities to reach theses areas. 
These prerequisities are not physical, you may or may not attain  (acquire) them in a class. These prerequisites are mental,
internal agreements. You have to tell your brain (universe? compiler?) that you want to do certain things, that way you dont
have to do extra work to accomplish things.
