# The Starting Line

Hello there Campers! 

Thank you for checking out Camp Sci, the place for lovers of all things science. First, let me walk you through a few things. I'm going to start this blog off by:

CHIEF EDITOR
Camille Camejo
B.S. Chemical Engineering, 2015 Howard University
Pursuing an MS in Computer Engineering         

Before English, Math was the first language Camille learned to understand. While friends and family would be outside having fun with the new toys they received during Christmas time, Camille would find joy in staying inside, trying to understand a math problem. You see, Mathematics was a world full of excitement and new, endless possibilities to her. She could spend hours and hours delving into different concepts and problems, always filled with equal anticipation for what new solution she would uncover. 

As the years went by, Camille harnessed her love for Math, discovered her deep interest in the world of Science and here we are. At the age of 23, she has attained her Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering but, with a little soul searching, she found her interest in science expanded beyond this umbrella of expertise into a metaphysical form. Her fascination with chemistry and physics would take her down another road, the road to Camp Sci. 

Camp Sci was created to channel existential findings relating directly to all different shapes and forms of science. Many people find it hard to relate Science to their daily lives, most don't necessarily see its direct involvement with their experiences. Layers and layers of self-reflecting moments while studying science has formed a gateway for Camille between understanding the world we live in, overstanding life and innerstanding our own divine minds and purposes as human beings whilst here on Earth. This doesn't happen overnight; thus presenting Camp Sci: a journey through science and the transcendental universe.  

To start this journey, we will begin with current circumstances and move forward from there. However, every good story has a bit of time travel and references to the past within its unfolding design. At the moment, Camille is pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Engineering, a new venture into parts unknown featuring coding languages, logic design and algorithms that are sure to surprise. The computer world has a mind of its own and together we will follow her while she discovers all of it's hidden secrets and possibilities. We may even meet a friend or two who we've met along the way!

So, get ready Campers! You're in for the ride of your life.
